Computer programmers create instructions for a computer to execute by writing and testing code that enables applications and software programs to operate successfully. Computer programmers use specialized languages to communicate with computers, applications and other systems to get computers and computer networks to perform a set of specific tasks. Languages like C++, Java, Python and more allow programmers – often working closely with software developers and engineers to build programs that allow “search, surfing and selfies,” according to ComputerScience.org.
